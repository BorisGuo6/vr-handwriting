# A virtual reality application as a pedagogical resource for children's handwriting learning and training

This repository contains a 3D application developed in [Unity](https://unity.com/) with the goal of assisting in the learning and training of children's handwriting. The application provides an interactive and engaging environment where children can practice writing letters, numbers, and words in a fun and intuitive way.

This project is being developed as a Final Year Project for the Computer Science program at the [Federal University of Pelotas (UFPel)](https://portal.ufpel.edu.br/), under the guidance of Professor [Rafael Torchelsen](http://lattes.cnpq.br/4828490550640720). The goal of this project is to create a 3D learning and handwriting training application. 

Currently, the application is in the development phase, and not all features are fully implemented.

## Features:
- Virtual 3D environment designed to simulate a playful learning atmosphere.
- Interactive writing exercises that guide children through the process of forming letters and numbers.
- Real-time feedback and visual cues to help children improve their handwriting skills.
- Customizable difficulty levels and personalized learning paths based on individual progress.
- Engaging audiovisual elements and rewards system to enhance motivation and engagement.
## How to Use:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open the project in Unity.
- Build and run the application on the desired platform (e.g., Windows, macOS, Android, iOS).
- Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the application and begin the handwriting training.

## Contribution Guidelines:
Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you would like to contribute to the development of this application, please follow these guidelines:
- Fork the repository and create a new branch for your contributions.
